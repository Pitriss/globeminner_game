Version: 1.0

WHAT IS ADDED?

  and a dye in the middle centre space of the crafting window.)
* 10 Decorative Wooden nodes which are perfect as floor tiles.
* 2 Picture tiles which are placed on the wall and form a full picture when used next to each other.
* Black wood planks which are perfect for a gothic floor. -- (Crafted with a wood plank and a black dye)
* Bamboo mat node which is again, perfect for flooring.
* 2 new stone tile nodes which make great walls.

DEPENDENCIES:
Default
Dye (already included with minetest)

KNOWN BUGS:
The nodes added with this Mod have no sound when walked over.
I couldn't figure out how to get the sounds to play without causing errors so for now they have been muted.
If you know how I can readd the sounds so they work properly please let me know.

Pitriss tuning containing:

* Sounds added
* Textures resized to 16x16 and fixed by Zelenavoda
* Added & changed recipes to not conflict with those in our game
